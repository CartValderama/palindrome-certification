# Palindrome Checker

This is a simple JavaScript-based palindrome checker, part of FreeCodeCamp's certification projects.

## Description

This project checks whether a given input string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

## How It Works

1. **Input Validation:** Ensures the input is not empty.
2. **Content Filtering:** Filters out non-alphanumeric characters and converts the remaining string to lowercase.
3. **Palindrome Check:** Compares characters from the start and end of the filtered string, moving towards the center, to determine if it's a palindrome.

## Usage

- Enter a word or phrase in the input box.
- Click the "Check" button.
- The result will display whether the input is a palindrome or not.
